A stock tracking application with a team:
A stock tracking application that pulls from Yahoo! Finance API in order to get up to date information on stocks and
any news related to stocks. Users can add and remove stocks from their portfolio to track, and the application
will store that in a database for the user and then show it on the main page of the user. The user can then
track the total value of their portfolio and select the graph for a specific stock or their entire portfolio.

Quick facts:
• Implemented front-end and backend code for a stock tracking website
• Integrated PHP with MySQL, High Charts API, and Yahoo! Finance API
• Daily Scrum meetings following agile methodologies
